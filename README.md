# Plant Palette

## 1. Overview

This project is a website design for a vegan restaurant. The main goal of the site was to provide users with a more intuitive experience where they could navigate easily and find information faster. This objective was based on a UX study we conducted using materials provided in class. We analyzed interview data and collected user feedback to identify the main challenges customers faced when trying to find information on the restaurant’s original website.

## 2. Development Process

1. **Research & Planning:**  
   I began by researching other vegan restaurant websites to understand what worked well and what didn’t. This competitive analysis helped me define which pages would be essential for my own site, based on the needs and expectations highlighted in the user interviews provided in our UX class. The main demands from users were to easily view the menu and prices, access a kids’ menu, and learn about the restaurant’s story, values, and contributions to the local community.

2. **Design:**  
   The design was created in Figma. I chose a color palette based on natural and vibrant tones—green `#525B00` and brown `#351006`—to reflect the brand's connection to health, freshness, and sustainability. The visual structure focuses on readability and user-friendly navigation, using clean layouts and modern fonts to create a pleasant experience.

3. **Development:**  
   The website was developed using HTML and CSS. I followed semantic HTML structure for accessibility and future scalability. I also used responsive design techniques to ensure the site works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

4. **Testing & Iteration:**  
   The coding process was iterative, and I made adjustments based on testing and feedback. Challenges included managing layout responsiveness and making the navigation intuitive. I overcame these issues by reviewing class materials and testing different CSS techniques.

5. **Deployment:**  
   Since this is an academic assignment and not a live project for a real client, the site was not deployed to a public domain. However, it can be viewed and tested locally by opening the `index.html` file in any web browser.

## 3. Challenges

The biggest challenge I faced was translating the design I created in Figma into fully functional code. For example, it was difficult to make the navigation and menu bars stay sticky at the top of the screen while scrolling. I had to make some design adjustments in order to achieve my goal of keeping the site accessible, responsive, and dynamic.

Another challenge was that, during the design phase, I didn't fully consider the interaction states like hover and active. This led me to add an extra color to the original palette—one that I hadn’t planned on using initially—in order to maintain good contrast and usability for those states.

In addition, implementing responsive design using media queries was more difficult than I expected. It took some trial and error to adjust the layout so that it would work smoothly on different screen sizes. I had to constantly test and refine the design to ensure that all elements adapted properly, especially images and navigation elements.

Despite these challenges, I was able to find solutions by researching documentation, reviewing class materials, and experimenting with different approaches until the desired result was achieved.

## 4. What I Learned

This project helped me better understand the full web development process, from UX research and design to coding and testing. It showed me how important it is to start with user needs and let that guide both structure and visual decisions.

I became more confident working with HTML, CSS, and media queries, and I improved my ability to build responsive layouts and adjust designs when necessary. I also gained experience translating design prototypes into functional code and solving unexpected layout or behavior issues along the way.

Completing this assignment gave me a stronger foundation in web development and design, and I feel more prepared to tackle future projects with a clear, user-centered approach.
